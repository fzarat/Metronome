# Metronome
Spring 2019 - Coding Connoisseurs

**About**

	Metronome is a tempo-keeping app that will help musicians, ameteur and pro, keep time. 
	The app will hold numerous bpms and can be changed to hold different time signatures 
	(¾, 4/4, ...), as well as provide the 4 basic subdivisions: quarter note, eighth note, triplet, and sixteenth note.
	Additionally, there will be a practice mode available for the user to keep track of how long they practiced, a 
	tap-for-tempo button that will allow the user to create their own tempos, and a quiz that will test the user on basic
	music theory.

**Setup**

	To clone and run Metronome Open Eclipse and select File->Import. In the import window, under the "Git" folder select 
	"Projects from Git". Then in the "Select Repository Source" window select "Clone URL" and click next. 
	Navigate to the github repository at https://github.com/fzarat/Metronome and click the green "clone or download" button and 
	copy the link. Paste this link into the URL field of the "Source Git Repository" window and fill "Authentication" field with your
	github credentials and click next. Select the master branch, and choose your local destination and click next. Select "Import
